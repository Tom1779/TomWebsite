Welcome to the Pokémon Image Identifier project! In this machine learning endeavor, My team and I set out on an exciting journey to combine the captivating world of Pokémon with the cutting-edge power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our goal was to create a sophisticated image recognition system capable of identifying various Pokémon species from images with remarkable accuracy.

This project was what our team which comprised of four people decided to do for our final assignment for our Machine Learning course. The goal of this recognition system was that it should be able to differeniate between 4 unique pokemon and classify them from just an image. The image below displays the different Pokemon we picked for this project.
